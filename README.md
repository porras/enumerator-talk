# Enumerator is an Enumerable ðŸ’ƒ

Examples from the talk I gave in RUG::B (Ruby Users Group Berlin) July 2015. There was a camera so I guess there will be a video at some point, I'll add it here.

Browse the examples in the `examples/` directory. You can also download and run them, they all work.

## Slides

Here are the slides, in case they are useful.

## The GIF

The animated gif with Nadine Angerer and Jennifer Cramer was ruined by the export so here it is:

## The No-Enumerator Edition

In case you were wondering what's possible with `Enumerator` that is not possible with `#each` (see the latest slides), the answer is nothing. In this branch, the following examples are rewritten *without* `Enumerator`:

* Fibonacci
* Clock
* Mixtape
